Is there anyone (staff or student) you do feel comfortable talking to about this? Was there any time where this did not happen (in the presence of someone else, at a time of day)?",

How often often is this happening? You mentioned each time you enter her office, but keeping a diary of occurences may be helpful if you do decide to speak with HR.
